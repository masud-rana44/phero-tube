      <div class="max-w-4xl">
        <!-- Question 1 -->
        <div class="mb-4">
          <h2 class="text-lg font-medium">
            1. Discuss the scope of var, let, and const
          </h2>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            In JavaScript, var, let, and const are used for declaring variables.
            Their scopes are different:
          </p>
          <ul class="ml-6 list-disc">
            <li>
              <strong>var:</strong> Function-scoped. Variables declared with var
              are hoisted to the top of their function or global context.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>let:</strong> Block-scoped. Variables declared with let
              are only accessible within the block they are declared in.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>const:</strong> Block-scoped. Similar to let, but const
              variables cannot be reassigned after declaration.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Question 2 -->
        <div class="mb-4">
          <h2 class="text-lg font-medium">
            2. Tell us the use cases of null and undefined
          </h2>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            <strong>null:</strong> It represents an intentional absence of any
            object value. Use it when you want to indicate that a variable
            should have no value.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            <strong>undefined:</strong> It typically means a variable has been
            declared but hasn't been assigned a value yet. It's the default
            value of function parameters.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Question 3 -->
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-lg font-medium">3. What do you mean by REST API?</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming
            Interface) is a set of rules and conventions for building and
            interacting with web services. It uses HTTP requests to perform CRUD
            (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources, which are
            represented as URLs. RESTful APIs are stateless and rely on standard
            HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE for communication.
